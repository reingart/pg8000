Version 1.01, 2007-03-09
------------------------

- Add support for writing floats and decimal objs up to PG backend.

- Add new error handling code and tests to make sure connection can recover
  from a database error.

- Fixed bug where timestamp types were not always returned in the same binary
  format from the PG backend.  Text format is now being used to send
  timestamps.

- Fixed bug where large packets from the server were not being read fully, due
  to socket.read not always returning full read size requested.  It was a
  lazy-coding bug.

- Added locks to make most of the library thread-safe.

- Added UNIX socket support.


Version 1.00, 2007-03-08
------------------------

- First public release.  Although fully functional, this release is mostly
  lacking in production testing and in type support.
