pg8000 is a DB-API 2.0 compatible Pure-Python interface to the PostgreSQL
database engine.  It is one of many PostgreSQL interfaces for the Python
programming language.  pg8000 is somewhat distinctive in that it is written
entirely in Python and does not rely on any external libraries (such as a
compiled python module, or PostgreSQL's libpq library).

pg8000 is available for Python 2.5 and 2.6 (and likely future 2.x releases); an
actively maintained and fully functional Python 3 branch of pg8000 called
pg8000-py3 is also available.

pg8000's name comes from the belief that it is probably about the 8000th
PostgreSQL interface for Python. pg8000 is distributed under the terms of a
modified BSD license.
